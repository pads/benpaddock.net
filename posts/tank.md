I'm going to be using [Tank](http://tank.peermore.com) to write down my thoughts and other such things for a while.  Tank was created by a former colleague of mine - Chris Dent.  Chris came up with Tank as a result of learning lessons from creating and using [TiddlySpace](http://tiddlyspace.com).  He's looking for [feedback](https://tank.peermore.com/tanks/docs/contact) to help shape Tank's direction.  

So head on over to [my tank](https://tank.peermore.com/tanks/pads/index) and (hopefully) enjoy the content.  I may or may not be back here in the future.
