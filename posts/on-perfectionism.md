Perfectionism is the unrelenting pursuit of reaching the highest possible standards and then still left wanting more.  It is a heavy burden that achieves nothing.  

It ruins relationships because it's not enough for you to be perfect - you start paying attention to the flaws in others and wish them gone.  It's not their flaws that will dissapear...

Being lazy becomes a problem, an uncomfortable feeling grows that you should be *doing something productive* (thanks, Capitalism).

The bed-fellow of anxiety, you feel that if you don't constantly achieve, you will fail.  The fear of failure is crippling and pointless.  If we don't fail, how do we learn and grow?

From the book [Less Perfect More Happy](https://smile.amazon.co.uk/Less-Perfect-More-Happy-Chris/dp/0957612370):

> Perfectionists worry.  They worry hard and they worry alone.  They don't worry about the present; they miss out on that while they worry about the past and the future - the past expectations they haven't lived up to and the expectations of a future they might not fulfill.

I've stressed out and aged myself too much following this dead-end path.  It's time to accept that good is good enough.  We are mere pinpricks in this ever-expanding universe after all.
