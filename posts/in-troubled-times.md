In troubled times.
We look to the past for comfort.
And the future for hope.
But what about the present?

Music from the 90s.
That new house with a cat and a garden.
The sky that is always blue.

That broken relationship.
Wondering will she ever speak to me again.
Feeling lost at sea.

An elevated heart rate.
These tense shoulders.
Climbing mountains.

Breath in, breath out.
Say hello to thoughts then wave them goodbye.
Rinse and repeat.

Relying on time and incremental change.
To get through to better days.
And on that first day with contentment and clarity.
Look back and smile.
