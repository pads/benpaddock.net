Paint a rainbow.
Nature’s colours have come to help you.

New patterns emerging.
Everyone is still learning.
Go easy, be gentle.

Realising what we cherish most.
Is still with us between these four walls.
In flesh or pixel form.

Dust off those running shoes.
Clean that paint brush.
Tune that guitar.

Grateful for the small things.
That delivery from your neighbours.
Those online game nights.

Take each day as it comes.
Tomorrow is tomorrow’s problem.
Embrace the new normal.

Empty ribbons of tarmac.
Fitter lungs.
Time on your side.

How to spend it best?
Paint a rainbow.
