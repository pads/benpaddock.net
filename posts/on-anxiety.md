I used to run the Birmingham JavaScript meetup group (BrumJS).  This involved finding one or more speakers to talk once a month, advertise and setup a venue with food and drink.  Looking back on this, I remember feeling anxious to the point where I thought I'd be letting the community down if I couldn't source speakers in time.  On the few occassions this did happen, I ended up putting together a last-minute talk myself.

Looking back on this, the worst thing that could have happened is a meetup didn't go ahead for one month.  Given that this was all volenteer-led and a pretty casual affair, this would have been a perfectly acceptable situation to end up in.

This is one of the many threads in my life that I've let anxiety turn something that is ok into something that is not.  I used to think that I was too anxious and that I should get rid of it.  However, after lots of reading and some self-reflection I've come to realise that you can't get rid of emotions, they are all there for a reason.  

The Pixar film [Inside Out](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2096673/) perfectly demonstrates this.  We follow characters that represent each emotion inside a girl's mind.  One of the characters is sadness and the other characters try to keep her from getting involved in how the girl feels.  We follow the girl as she moves home and has to deal with a lot of change (a new school, for example).

One day there is an accident and joy and sadness dissapear for a while, leaving anger, fear and digust in charge.  The girl struggles to express herself as she navigates these big changes in her life.  In the end, when joy and sadness are reunited with the others, they realise that it is sadness who is needed most right now for the girl, so that she can express to her parents how upset she is and how she misses where they used to live.
