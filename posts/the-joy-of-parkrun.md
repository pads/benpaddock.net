For me, Parkrun is one of the best exercise and mental wellbeing initiatives out there. Run or walk 5KM (3.1 miles) on a Saturday morning in a local park for free.

As a volunteer, a smile and words of encouragement whilst donned in your (rather fetching) pink high-vis can really make someone's morning and make them go that bit further or faster.

As a runner, there is the hit of endorphins and a chance to release the stress from the week.

It's not a race and there is no pretentiousness or elitism. You be you and run your own run. Turn up in whatever gear works.

I've been blessed with making some new friends and enjoying the social side of this event. I'm still a cyclist first and foremost but the running comes easier when the weather gets bad.

I'm writing this after celebrating a friends 250th Parkrun. The milestones are a great incentive to keep showing up and recognise that achievement. Viva le Parkrun!
