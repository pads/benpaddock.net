One of my more recent fond stories of kindness was a trip to Colchester zoo.  There was a long queue for tickets but my friends all had passes to get in.  I would have been waiting on my own for quite some time but a person at the front of the queue bought me a ticket so I could skip it (I did pay him).  I don' know the guy's name but that made my day.

Just one small, random act of kindness.
