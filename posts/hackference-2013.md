I spent today at [Hackference](http://hackference.co.uk/), the conference part in Digbeth, Birmingham. I’ll be writing a full report at some point but here is a highlight.

This is a demo of a [drone](http://ardrone2.parrot.com/) being controlled via Xbox connect and a node application:

Unfortunately I didn’t video the other attempt where the drone nearly dive-bombed several developers!
